Following up on previous [post](http://www.clowersresearch.com/main/open-source-modular-approaches-to-ion-mobility-spectrometry/), we’ve finally released a major update to the Open Source IMS Initiative. Appearing now in [Hardware X](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2018.e00030) we detail a new modular IMS design that is extremely flexible. Three of our ASMS 2018 posters feature data from these system and the are proving an invaluable new tool to our research infrastucture. Though the current systems are limited to lower temperature operation (i.e < 80 °C), the designs are readily adapted to Rogers material which is quite robust well above 200 °C. Another key adaptation making this design tractable is the new ion shutter design which uses 3 grids to create a set of well defined ion pulses. Though the BN-gates are attractive in that the physical structure is in a single plane, their construction is an art. Moreover, the fields established by the BN gates are also, by no means, fully planar. With the new design we can achieve that smooth field in the region surrounding the ion gate and still get extremely small ion gate pulse widths (i.e < 20 μs). If you are interested in some of the core details or have suggestions for improvement, come find us on github: [https://github.com/bhclowers/OS-IMS](https://github.com/bhclowers/OS-IMS "https://github.com/bhclowers/OS-IMS")
