# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hey, I’m Elvin Cabrera. I joined the Clowers research group in Fall of 2019. I recently graduated with my B.S. in chemistry from Eastern Washington University where my research focused on development of analytical methods for biofuels using Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). I’m still exploring what topics my research will focus on; ideally my research will be analytical in nature with overlap in physical and biochemistry.
